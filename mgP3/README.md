# MGP3

This is the third and final mini-group project from CS 594.

### accelerometer

The accelerometer code is modified example code from the sparkfun IMU library. It is used to write the IMU values to the servo motors. This is a implementation prototype that was made closer to the end of development.

### main\_receiver

This is the code that is used on the board that receives the IMU data over WiFi. This board also controls the 4 servo motors and game board.

### main\_sender\_acc

Code to send IMU values to the game board which will use it to tilt the maze.
